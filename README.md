# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project is a pixelated image of Toad from Mario Kart. It is only Toad's head and I chose to draw him because I originally wanted to do Shy Guy, but I decided to switch it up and do something different this year. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things about my project that I am proud of was being able to go smoothly through this project with little debugs or errors and being able to create what I had sketched out. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something I would impove on this project would be to create better selection statements and loops. I also wish that my methods I created would work in PainterPlus instead of MuralPainter, but more useful stuff for my code were in muralPainter so I had to extend ToadPainter off of it.
